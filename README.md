# npm version patch explaination

When you run npm version patch, the following happens:

Increment the PATCH version number: If your current version is 1.0.0, running this command will update the version in your package.json to 1.0.1.
Create a git commit: The command will create a new git commit with a message like v1.0.1 (the new version number).
Create a git tag: The command will create a new git tag with the new version number.
Why You Might Need to Run npm version patch Frequently
Version Control: Incrementing the version number ensures that each update to your package.json is properly versioned, making it easier to track changes and releases.
Dependency Management: If your package is used as a dependency in other projects, incrementing the version number helps those projects manage dependencies correctly, ensuring they are using the latest version of your package.
Release Workflow: For automated deployment and release workflows, updating the version number is often required to trigger builds, deployments, or releases in CI/CD pipelines.
